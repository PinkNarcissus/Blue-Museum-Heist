Might as well call the international museum of stolen art though, but we are here to do something about that. Our clients are an... association of people who want to take back what was stolen from them.","\n","^It'll work like this. First, we plan the heist. Use the money we have to get tools, maybe buy some intel. We got a gal on the inside. Look at the map and try to pick a route and figure out what you might need for it. Shit happens of course, but it's good to have a plan A. Or, wing it. I'm not the master thief here, what do I know.","\n","^After that, it's time for the actual heist. I'll be with you the whole time right here, walking you through things. You can use the map to keep track of where you and other important things are.","\n","^Your goal is to retreive the three treasures we've been sent to reclaim. But is that truly as paramount as looking good doing it? Imagine the cameras are on you the whole time. They very well might be, and what you do will end up in the news. Wouldn't want to look like an amateur, now, would you? I'll keep track of your Style for you, so you can focus on the less important things, like staying alive.","\n","^So.
